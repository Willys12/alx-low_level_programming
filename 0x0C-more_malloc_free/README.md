# C - More malloc, free

## Learning Objectives
In this project the objective is to dig deeper in knowing more about the malloc & free functions. Other functions are calloc & realloc.

## General
- How to use the exit function. 
  The exit function is used to terminate the program in case it fails.
- What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them.
  The calloc function allocates memory that is required and initializes all bits to zero.
  The realloc function as the name suggests is used to reallocate memory in case of insufficiency or in the case where memory allocated initially is in excess.
